# dh-frontend-case

This the small project I developed while applying to [DeliveryHero](https://www.github.com/deliveryhero).

This is a React SPA app. I've started with a custom webpack setup allowing typescript and sass to be used. Designs were provided to me (old Yemeksepeti interface) together with some dummy data.

My developments are on the development branch and can be seen in [this PR](https://github.com/berkinanik/dh-frontend-case/pull/1).

Also, there is a preview deployment of the app: https://elegant-capybara-9b46cc.netlify.app/
